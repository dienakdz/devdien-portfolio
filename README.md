## 🤖 Pair Programming with AI

This project was built through a collaborative process between **Minh Dien** and **Antigravity (AI Coding Assistant by Google DeepMind)**. 

While I provided the vision, domain expertise in Backend development, and real-world project data, the AI assisted in rapidly prototyping components, implementing the design system with Tailwind v4, and ensuring clean, maintainable code structures. 

*Why use AI?* To accelerate the development cycle while focusing on what matters: the architecture and the story.
